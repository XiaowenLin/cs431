irobot project code

Server is a thin layer between all codes implementing robot features and control program. 
Server on the beagle board should receive commands thru TCP/IP using JSON format, and will send back status code in the same way. 
Server uses multithreading to handle each request. 
Update HOST variable in __init__.py file to the inet of beagle board so that the connection will work. 

TODO:
1. define how JSON will encode commands in github wikipage
2. add to server.py to control roomba based on commands from client. add an execution queue in server, so that all commands received will be executed in order.
